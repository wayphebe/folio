                    <br><br> For students new to kiltie band, it is difficult to identify  over 10 parts of the uniform. Also, since each parts are connected with one another, it needs additional efforts to put on the uniform.

            <li><strong>Focus on the Use of Verbs.</strong><br>
                Verbs guide the audience to follow the instructions. Putting verbs first helps readers to understand each step.

            <li><strong>Keep Your Audience in Mind.</strong><br>
              Expecting readers' problems and reaction will help us write with a goal and focus. Address these difficulties in the writing will create a better experience for the audience.
