                <br><br>By allowing group members expressing their ideas and granting them equal oppurtunities to choose , VOCO facilitates the decision-making process and motivates the team participation.

                    How might we improve the group work experience for small student teams?

                    <strong>Diverse personalities </strong>and <strong>dissimilar working norms </strong>may lead to the storm in the team work.

                    <br><br>Meanwhile, coming from diverse backgrounds, we all have different working norms.
                    <br>While some people tend to use slack, others might stick to whatapp. When some people enjoy meeting in person, some prefer meeting in virtual space. In this case, we need to communicate with each other about their preference and make decision between options. 
                    <br><br><strong>So, how can we embrace differences and ensure collaboration within a group?     </strong>

                            <li>I conducted a comparative analysis on the current market, examining the niche of the teamworl solutions.</li>

                            <br>However, there are also opportunities for this market. <strong>Since many products are either expensive, burdensome or confusing, there is a need to find a balance between simplicity and functionality. </strong>

                <br>We take on task and work by interest and strengths. 
                <br>Unlike professional workforce,  a student team does not have a program manager or boss who assigns group work and push the process. 
                <br><br><strong>Also, we tend to maintain a harmonious peer relationship while working with classmates.</strong>
                <br>We spend time waiting for a response or an agreement to make sure everyone is satisfied. 
                <br><br><strong>Similarly, we have different time schedule and diverse personalities and work habits </strong> 
                <br>Therefore, it is not easy for students to share ideas and make decisions.  
                <br><br><strong>As a result, we waste time on waiting and deciding, but not spending enough time on communicating and working. </strong>

                <li> Narrowing dowon the focus in an early stage of design. VOCO 1.0 attempts to intergrate all key feaures yet it does not hit the painpoints. This resulte from I have not narrowed down my focus in an earlier research phase. Thus, I need to scrutinze my problem statement again to find the focus of this topic.</li>
                <li> Design research is not a linear process. As I stated above, there are times that is essential for designers to go back and start again. It might be difficult to analyze your thought process, but it will be an eureka moment when you sincerely focus on the problem and empathize with the users. </li>
                <li>Care about the problems no matter how big or small the market is. Inclusiveness  is and will always be my principle for design. During interview, most users think that their problems might be trivial and not worthy of research. However, they actually share many problems together, and these painpoints can be applied to a larger crowd. Therefore, I do believe that designers should not only design for the market but truly design for people. </li>
