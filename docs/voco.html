                <br><br>Its goal is to create an inclusive and a supportive collaborative environment which empowers all members in the group decision making process. 
                <br><br>By allowing group members expressing their ideas and granting them equal oppurtunities to choose , VOCO facilitates the decision-making process and motivates the team participation.

                    How might we improve the group work experience for small student teams?

                    <strong>Diverse personalities </strong>and <strong>dissimilar working norms </strong>may lead to the storm in the team work. 
                    <br><br>Extroverts and introverts convey their ideas in different ways. Sometimes introvers may be hidden in the discussion. 
                    <br><br>Meanwhile, coming from diverse backgrounds, we all have different working norms.
                    <br>While some people tend to use slack, others might stick to whatapp. When some people enjoy meeting in person, some prefer meeting in virtual space. In this case, we need to communicate with each other about their preference and make decision between options. 
                    <br><br><strong>So, how can we embrace differences and ensure collaboration within a group?     </strong>

                            <li>I conducted a comparative analysis on the current market, examining the niche of the teamworl solutions.</li>

                            <li>I interviewed five students about their groupwork experience, and gained insights from the analysis.</li>

                            Under each main categories, there are even more applications targeting at different users. Since collaborative tools market is extremely mature, the challenge would be to disvocer the gap. 
                            <br>However, there are also opportunities for this market. <strong>Since many products are either expensive, burdensome or confusing, there is a need to find a balance between simplicity and functionality. </strong>

                        My five interviewees shared with me their groupwork experiences.

                <p class="main__text">The characteristics of student teams explain why my first prototype wouldnâ€™t work. 
                <br><br>First of all, student team do not have a designated leader. 
                <br>We take on task and work by interest and strengths. 
                <br>Unlike professional workforce,  a student team do not have program manager or a boss who assign group work and push the process. 
                <br><br>Also, we tend to maintain a harmonious peer relationship while working with classmates.
                <br>We spend time waiting for response or achieving on an agreement to make sure everyone is happy. 
                <br><br>Furthermore, we interpret cummunication cues and signals differently as we coming from dissimilar background.  
                <br>Thus,  soemtimes we might have misunderstanding towards others. Also, to avoid confivts, we may hide out true opinions and ideas.  
                <br><br>As a result, we waste time on waiting and deciding and not  spending enough time on communicating and working.

        <br><h1 class="main__headline">VOCO 2.0</h1>
        <p class="main__text">Now my focus is narrowing down on helping team achieving agreements. 
                <br>Just like in the fiction, each time characters makes choices develop the plot, we make decision to move forward the group process and thus boost teamwork productivity.
                <br>Therefore, this brings out the goal of VOCO. 
                <br>It aims to assist the team to make decisions and achieve agreement. Accordingly, everyone can engage in the decision making process. And most importantly, the ultimate goal is to sharing opinions and achieve understanding.

        <ul class="main__subpoints">
                <li> Narrowing dowon the focus in an early stage of design. VOCO 1.0 attempts to intergrate all key feaures yet it does not hit the painpoints. This resulte from I have not narrowed down my focus in an earlier research phase. Thus, I need to scrutinze my problem statement again to find the focus of this topic.</li>
                <li> Design research is not a linear process. As I stated above, there are times that is essential for designers to go back and start again. It might be difficult to analyze your thought process, but it will be an eureka moment when you sincerely focus on the problem and empathize with the users. </li>
                <li>Care about the problems no matter how big or small the market is. Inclusiveness  is and will always be my principle for design. During interview, most users think that their problems might be trivial and not worthy of research. However, they actually share many problems together, and these painpoints can be applied to a larger crowd. Therefore, I do believe that designers should not only design for the market but truly design for people. </li>
