                        <strong>“Design and produce a product suitable for use by pre-adolescent children, incorporating the use of active technology, to improve health maintenance and outcomes.”  </strong>
					<br><br>
                            Given the design challenge stated above, we kicked off our project with a series of interviews and a survey to get a better understanding of user behaviour and their pain points. 
                            
                            Based on the insights we gained from the interviews, we conducted an affinity analysis by clustering similar findings. 
                            <br><br><strong>It allowed us to identify three recurring pain points that have been brought up by different users - Unpleasant wake-up experience,  Lack of hydration, Poor time management</strong>.

                <p class="main__text">
                    We conducted three brainstorming sessions for the pain points discovered from the last step. A list of preliminary ideas have been generated and made into 7 concept cards. In order to narrow down our design focus, we conducted second round of interviews to test the concept cards. 
                    <img src="assets/images/CONCEPTS.png" width="700">   
                    The result of the concept cards test showed that both kids and parents showed more interests about how to solve the problem of dehydration. Therefore, we decided to focus on the dehydration issue. 
                    <br>From the interviews, we learned that there are three main pain points/needs associated with children’s lack of water consumption, which are <strong>lacking of motivation, lacking of awareness, and desire to be informed of their daily hydration</strong>.

                    <br>After narrowing down our focus to hydration problem, we conduct another round of secondary research.
